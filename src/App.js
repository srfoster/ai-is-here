### Introduction

#### 1.

The impact of AI-assisted writing is best understood in context of two other famous technological arrivals – of machines in general and of computers in particular.

Once upon a time, as the story goes, labor was something done exclusively by human hands.  Then came the machines – not all of a sudden, but pretty quickly once they got going.  The Luddites of the early 1800s did try to resist, managing to burn down a few factories.  But in the end, the machines won.  

Next (after much economic upheaval and a couple of big wars) came a very special kind of machine called the computer.  Unlike your run-of-the-mill machine, the computer could do something very important – something that had previously been a human-only form of labor: namely, math.  

To make a long story short, the digital revolution proved that a lot of cool stuff actually boiled down to "really fast math" – everything from putting pixels on your screen, to reading the mouse and keyboard, to making the internet work, to *Fortnite*.  Bit by bit (byte by byte), the computers won.

Now, [AI](/#/footnote/ai-informal) has arrived.  And by "arrived" – I mean that AI can, at times, perform what was once believed to be another human-only kind of labor: namely, writing.  AI-writing isn't perfect, and it can't write everything – but admit it, dear reader: 

> *You know in your heart that some parts of this very text might have been AI-generated, and you can never be sure exactly which ones.*

Even if I could somehow convince you I wrote this myself ("Look, Ma!  No ChatGPT!"), three inconvenient truths remain:

* Much writing can be automated.
* New types of automation tend to change the nature of work.
* When work changes, systems of education must adapt.

Lately, as an educator and writer (of much software and even a few books), I've begun using AI in my lectures and professional writing.  The more it increases my productivity, the more I find myself mulling certain questions as I lay awake at night.  (Who will lose their jobs?  If writing can be automated, what else can?  And how must education adapt?)

What follows are the answers I've found, prepared in a way that I hope will be useful to other writers, educators, students (including mine), and even just the average worrier.  It's a wild world.

If you've made it this far, then I want to let you in on a secret.  Click below to find out what it is!`,

  (extraProps) => <ClickToReveal
    contents={[
      `Nice!  You clicked a button.  The secret that this book is interactive.  Stay tuned for more of that (and be on the lookout for Easter eggs).`,
      `You found an Easter Egg!`,
      `Okay, you can stop clicking now.  I promise there are no more Easter eggs.`
    ]}
    {...extraProps}

Not only is this an interactive document.  It's also a living one, as any meaningful text about a moving target must inevitably be.  What I mean is that as AI-writing tools improve, I'll update the text to reflect the new reality.

There are certain things that AI-writing tools simply cannot do and some things that they can do quite well.  This book is designed to help readers understand the difference, so we'll be looking at a lot of benchmarks like this one:`,

  (extraProps) => <Benchmark
     name="Write a Novel" 
     goal="Get an AI to write a novel that I'd actually want to read."
     modelsTested="GPT 3.5 and GPT 4.0"
     result="FAILED"
      {...extraProps}
  />,

`I'll admit, this benchmark might seem unfair at first glance.  Maybe I don't even like novels.  Maybe I have unreasonably high standards.  Who am I to appoint myself judge?  Look, these are valid concerns.   But if I may:

* I'm not subjecting AI to harsher criticism than human writers have been since the birth of writing (3400 BCE).  Writing is good if readers like it.
* Moreover, I'm not publishing these benchmarks in hopes that you'll accept my results; rather, I'm asking you to evaluate each benchmark for yourself.

In other words, when you see a benchmark like the one above, [please](/#/footnote/homework-for-my-students) take a moment to open up your favorite AI-writing tool and use whatever clever prompting tricks you'd like.  In particular, are your results different from mine?  Partly, this is for you (dear reader) – much like the exercises in a mathematics textbook, serving to imbue you with new intuitions about the subject.

But partly, it's for me and for your fellow human readers: We need your help maintaining this living document.  AI-writing tools and the techniques for prompting them are advancing.  So please [get in touch](/#/footnote/contact-me) if you ever find that your results differ from mine.  All you have to do is send me the output of your awesome AI-written novel along with a prompting process I can replicate.  If your novel (or one that pops out from your process) seems enjoyable to me, I'll update the benchmark, rewrite this section, and list you under the **Acknowledgements** section of this book.  Pinky swear! 

We'll look at a lot of benchmarks in the coming pages – some easy, some hard, some passed, some failed – all of them relevant to students, educators, and humanity in general.  The reason I started with the novel-writing benchmark is that I want to use it momentarily to illustrate something important about the underlying technology of AI-writing – namely that the number of words a model like GPT 4.0 can "think about" is 8,000.  This is also known as its "context window."

To put this in perspective, the first Harry Potter novel is about 77,000 words.  An AI-writing tool that attempts to write such a book will, after the first 8000 words, begin to forget what it previously wrote.

This is what makes the novel-writing benchmark so interesting – it's an open question whether the 8000-word "context window" can be circumvented (either now or in the future). Optimists would point out that human authors don't keep every previous word in mind while writing new ones.  Thus, perhaps a clever prompter could simulate a human writing process by continually supplying the AI with a running 500-word "summary-thus-far," while asking it to generate 7,500 words at a time.  Do this 10 times and... *bam!* – you have a novel!

If you get good results with this methodology, please get in touch, so I can update the benchmark.  But please know: I've poured many hours into this problem, tried various such tricks, and generated nothing but trash.  (More on this later – because sometimes even trash can be instructive.)

I'll close this section by mentioning a strange internet phenomenon I've noticed:

* YouTube is filling up with videos about "How to Write a Book with ChatGPT"? 
* Everything I've generated with these techniques sucks.

Again, maybe it's me.  Or maybe (just maybe) the labor of authoring book-length works can't be fully automated.  My current assumption is that it won't be (not for a long time, if ever).  In fact, I've based a lot of what follows on this assumption.
This means that if I'm wrong, then two things will become instantly true:

* I'll have to re-write much of what follows.
* I won't be the one doing the work.

If you'd like to be notified when I update this book, please [email me](mailto:stephen@thoughtstem.com) and I'll add you to my mailing list.  Althernatively, you can subscribe to the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/srfoster/ai-is-here), although I can't promise that I'll only push updates to the book.  I'm a programmer, so I'll be pushing code to the repo as well.
