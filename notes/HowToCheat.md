* Documentary-style "story arc"
  - Maybe "How to cheat with AI" won't be loved by faculty (Lindsey's insight)
  - Can we think of a Michelle-Khare-esque high concept?
  - Personally, I'm motivated by interviewing my fellow faculty members, getting them to help me make the content, and telling a cool story that the whole OC community will appreciate.
  - Add some assignments, metacognitive reflections, assessments, and BAM -- cool YouTube content becomes (also) a course

TODO:
  - Reach out to... Candice Morrow, Davis Smith, <<Sage Westfall?>>, <<Math?>>, <<SSH?>>
  - Tile for "How to Cheat With AI (And When You Shouldn't)"
